          Funny/Interesting item about yourself: Well I’m not funny so I’m not
          sure if I’m interesting but when I’m asked “What are we?” or “What’s
          your sign?”, my response is “human”. I find humor in odd ways.
        </li>
        <li>
          More on me: I lived in Okinawa, Japan while stationed at Kadena AB for
          a year and served in the USAF as an inspection specialist for the
          F-15C model fighter jet. I sometimes dabble in some gaming like World
          of Warcraft and Valorant. I live a very healthy lifestyle and strive
          to have a positive mindset that is beneficial for myself and others.
