      <p>
        I, <a href="introduction.html">Thomas M. Sikes</a> agree to abide by the
        terms in my 2024 Semester Web215-N801 with my
        instructor, Prof. D.I. Von Briesen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites
        will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information
        there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep
        private.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
        logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments
        may show as an absences.
      </p>
