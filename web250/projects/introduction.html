        <li><strong>Personal background:</strong> I was born in Monroe, NC.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> Former lineman. Previously worked for Charlotte Pipe & Foundry for 5+ years. I have a lot of hard labor under my belt. I only just recently decided to take better care of my body and pursue college to work with my mind instead (work smarter, not harder). Currently employed at Autobell Carwash corporate office.</li>
        <li><strong>Academic background:</strong> HS graduate & in my last semester for a 2-year degree in Full Stack Programming (AAS).</li>
        <li><strong>Background in this subject:</strong> Web110, Web115</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 11</li>
        <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>WEB215 - Adv Web Markup and Scripting - WHY</strong> - I need it to graduate.</li>
                <li><strong>WEB250 - Database Driven Websites - WHY</strong> - I also need this to graduate.</li>
                <li><strong>CSC221 - Advanced Python Programming - WHY</strong> - This course is also needed to graduate.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>I love building PCs for myself and helping others on their rigs as well.</strong> I am big on encoding and helping people set up for live streaming on any platform. Love working with DAW and virtual audio. Music is massive for me. I sing and play guitar occasionally. Not as much as I used to and should.</li>
